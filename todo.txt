to do:
----
program to generate Official API documentation page?
compiled variant

changes
-----
(hopefully) fixed strange behavior of import lock...
    - even with only 1 thread, `imp.lock_held` returns True when no code in versionhelper has called `imp.acquire_lock` yet
        - only happens when run via `python -m versionhelper.main`
added README.md
